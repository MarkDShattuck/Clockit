 Description:
 A few modification to the firmware code for the Sparkfun Clockit Alarm Clock Kit 
 Clockit KIT-10930(https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10930)
    1) Update Makefile.
    2) Update interrupt names.
    3) New description.
    4) Fix apostrophe/clear_display() code.
    5) Fix TCNT1 changed during interrupt.
 
 Functions: 
 Display => time HH:MM, AM/PM, seconds -> colon blink, alarm ON/OFF
 Time    => SET
 Alarm   => SET/ON/OFF/+9M Snooze, BUZZER

 Hardware:
 4-digit 7-segment display and ATmega328P micro-controller 
 
 To use:
 1) Build Clockit kit.  
 2) Add optional 6-pin programming header (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/116)
 3) Install drivers for AVR programmer like: (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9825)
 4) Install WinAVR or similar (http://sourceforge.net/projects/winavr/)
 5) Check programming chain: avrdude -c usbtiny -p m328p
 6) Download these files: https://github.com/MarkDShattuck/Clockit 
 7) Compile and install new software: make program 
 
 Detailed Description:
 Basic Alarm Clock using the Atmel 8-bit ATmega328P micro-controller and a common 
 anode 7-segment 4-digit LED panel.  Hardware is from SparkFun Clockit KIT-10930 
 (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10930 ). The timebase is set by an external
 16MHz crystal oscillator.  Three push buttons (UP/DOWN/SNOOZE) and one switch 
 (ALARM ON/OFF) control operations.  Time is indicated in 12-hour format HH:MM 
 using a dot (apostrophe) to indicate AM/PM.  Seconds are displayed by blinking 
 the colon.  Alarm set is controlled by the switch and indicated by the decimal 
 point on digit 4.  A piezo-electric buzzer sounds the alarm and the snooze 
 button silences the sound for 9 minutes.  A CLOCK SET mode is entered by pressing 
 and holding both the UP and DOWN buttons.  In CLOCK SET mode the UP and DOWN 
 buttons advance or decrease the time with accelerating rate as the button is 
 held.  Pressing SNOOZE ends CLOCK SET mode.  An ALARM SET mode is entered by 
 pressing and holding the SNOOZE button.  In ALARM SET mode the alarm time is
 displayed and the UP and DOWN buttons advance or decrease the time with
 accelerating rate as the button is held.  Pressing SNOOZE ends ALARM SET 
 mode.

            v11 jl  modified for new common anode 7-segment 4-digit display
 12/28/2013 Mark D. Shattuck <mds> 
            v12 mds Update Makefile for AVRmega328P
                    Change:
                    -SIG_OVERFLOW1 => TIMER1_OVF_vect
                    -SIG_OVERFLOW2 => TIMER2_OVF_vect
                    Add new description
                    Fix apostrophe cathode: Should be PC1 not PC2.
                    Fix clear_display()
                    -remove amMark/2 (not needed with correct clear_display)
                    -cleaned up display_number() 
                    Softened turn on buzz.
 12/29/2013 v12 mds Changed Timer1 to CTC mode (WGM 12) since setting TCNT1 during 
                    ISR loses a few clock cycles. Small effect ~10*1/16e6=0.625us
                    per interrupt ~ 1s / month
